Bank Term Deposit Marketing Analysis 🏦📊
Project Overview:
The objective of this project is to analyze bank marketing campaign data to identify the key factors that influence a customer's decision to subscribe to a Term Deposit. Using a dataset of over 45,000 customer records from Kaggle, I performed exploratory data analysis (EDA) to uncover actionable business insights.

Key Objectives:
1. Customer Segmentation: Categorizing customers based on Job, Age, Marital Status, and Education levels.

2. Success Metrics: Determining the correlation between average account balance and conversion rates.

3. Strategic Insights: Providing data-driven recommendations for marketing teams to prioritize high-potential customer profiles.

Tech Stack Used:
1. Excel: Used for initial data profiling, cleaning, and understanding the 'train' and 'test' datasets.

2.Tableau: Developed interactive dashboards for visual storytelling and demographic performance tracking.

3.GitHub: Utilized for version control and professional project documentation.

Dashboard Highlights & Key Insights:
1. Conversion by Profession: Management professionals and Technicians showed the highest volume of successful subscriptions.

2. Age Performance: While the 30-45 age group has the highest contact volume, conversion trends vary significantly across different life stages.

3. Financial Profile: Customers who subscribed to the term deposit generally maintained a higher average balance compared to those who did not.
